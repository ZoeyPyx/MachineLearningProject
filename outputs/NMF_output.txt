- &gt;PHYSICS CANNOT EVEN TELL YOU WHAT AN ATOM IS MADE OF. You already admitted this.   &gt;&gt;Of course it can. Even if we haven't discovered the answer yet it's an absolute certainty that the answer is rooted in physics. Or in what physics is rooted in which is math. All of reality is mathematical.  I clearly didn't  &gt;"Why should...physics." &gt; &gt;Physics is incapable of describing even fhe most fundemental aspect of reality, by your own admission.   Again I never admitted this.  &gt;No I dont?   You really do. It is impossible to know what isn't unless you know what is. I know the Earth is NOT flat because I know that it IS round.  &gt;See: "BAAAHAHAHAHAHAH Noooo" post.  This conversation is devolving  &gt;So?  That is not my burden.   Your consciousness can't experience what you are and it knows this and yet it's dumb enough to think that there is a you in it. Hilarious.  &gt;"What...thing?"  &gt;Lolwut?  Answer the question, do you believe your a thing or not? There's things and nothing's. You can only be one of the two. So if you're a thing tell me what it is, if you're nothing then you don't exist.  &gt;What do reactions have to do with anything?   Things are what they do. Everything is reacting to itself. Cars drive, planes fly and consciousness reacts consciously and since we both agree that you are not your consciousness that means you cannot react to a thing. You are a thing that can't do anything. You know what else can't do anything? Nothing, and nothing is something that isn't.  &gt;How did you come to such an erroneous conclusion?  Spiderman is ink on paper. The ink exists (within your hypothetical space).  Thats all I ever asserted.  Again you misconstrue existence as being a nature of existence.   Is Spiderman having a thought? Yes or no? You avoided the question because you know what the answer implies. If spiderman is not having a thought then neither are you.  &gt;"Also this whole thing." &gt; &gt;Whole thing?   What don't you understand about everything affecting everything? If we exist and we're trying to figure out what we are then we have to talk about everything because it's what we come from.  &gt;"Nothing exists....everything." &gt; &gt;Baseless assertion is baseless.   What don't you understand about everything affecting everything? If we exist and we're trying to figure out what we are then we have to talk about everything because it's what we come from.  &gt;"If spiderman...in." &gt; &gt;See: "BAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Nooooo" post.  Take it seriously. Can you honestly say that spiderman is experiencing reality. And when you break reality down to it's fundamentals can you honestly say that your reality is any different.  &gt;But thinking necessitates existence, for something has the thought.   Did you think this or did the thought pop up completely out of your control?  &gt;Right, but thats laughably incorrect.  That which jas the experience of the thought, exists.  Its so simple.   You still haven't even proved that you experience anything. All moments exist and all moments are still frames, there's nothing to be experienced. It's so simple.  &gt;Not really relevant.  This is a specualtion of the NATURE of existence.  How many times must it be shown to you before youll grasp this? It's tiresome, like trying to teach a rock.   Everything is relevant to this topic.  &gt;No.  I dont even agree that the universe exists, tbh.  Theres no evidence for that.    What the fuck. Are you a "flat earther"?   &gt;The self exists, the self is A PSYCHOLOGICAL CONSTRUCTION.  It exists because your brain makes it exist.  That is an existence.   You don't believe there is evidence for a universe but you believe brains exist and can make things exist just by thinking it?  &gt;NO! Lol, why would you assume the "self" and "you" are the same thing?    &gt; &gt;Your "self" is your "identitity", your idea of who you are, defined by the mind and constructed by the environment.   According to you identity would be my consciousness which I don't believe I am and you seem to agree. I still wouldn't equate that with self.  &gt;YOU is THAT WHICH HAS THE EXPERIENCE OF EXISTENCE.  YOU have a "self", a psycho-construct of identity.   There is no me, only reality  &gt;But YOU is simply that which HAS the experience of possessing a "self"  My consciousness has not experienced a self.  &gt;Read this, repeatedly and very slowly. YOU ARE THAT WHICH HAS THE EXPERIENCE OF EXISTENCE.   I haven't had that experience. My consciousness has memories that tell it that it has lived a life. That's all it knows is memories. Whether or not those memories were actually experienced or not who knows.  &gt;Full stop.  Everything beyond that is, at best, an extension OF you and probably has nothing to do with YOU at all.  My entire awareness is an extension of me but what my awareness is rooted to it does not know because it has never seen me.  &gt;As you said, I could wake up with your memories and identity.  But that would be ME HAVING THE EXPERIENCE OF YOUR MEMORIES.   I'm just going to cut to it. We're all nothing. We're all the same person conceived in every position available for us to be conceived in. We're the same dude surrounded by a different consciousness. Your just a dot, a defined location of spacetime in a small bubble of awareness. There is absolutely no difference between us.  &gt;Do you understand?  You need to shed the idea of "self" being part of you.  Your identity is a psychosocial construction.  You dont even create it, your environment does and uses the mechanism of your physical brain to do so FOR you.   I don't believe in a self or a me  &gt;YOU have nothing to do with your identity.  Those are two different things.  Thats why its YOUR identity. Its something YOU possess and experience.  &gt; &gt;YOU ARE THAT WHICH HAS THE EXPERIENCE.  Stop saying that. You can't prove that you've experienced anything. I'll concede that you do exist...as nothing more than a character in my mind.  I'm done for the night. I'll check back in the morning. If you respond make sure you quote properly. Going back and forth was a pain in the dick.

- I'm going to count Everytime you laugh and say noooo as an immature concession.  &gt;"Pending response"X2 &gt; &gt;Wut?  Reread my comment, I had to go back to read what I said and edit my comment as I'm typing it in order to give a proper response several times because you refuse to quote me properly. So please quote me properly, quit abbreviating it. It would make this conversation go a lot more smoothly.  &gt;Thats the same thing.  Why do you think I think I consciously generate my thoughts?  No ones arguing that. But having thoughts at all is prove of experience which is proof of existence.  Or, as Descarts put it: Cogito, ergo: Sum  It's proof that consciousness experiences itself, not that you experience yourself. No one is arguing that existence doesn't exist. We're arguing about whether or not you exist, not the things we call "yours" such as your consciousness exist.  &gt;Yes, I have.  You just dont want to accept it. Which is more your problem than mine.    Your able to type out these long winded responses. Surely fleshing out what your consciousness thinks you are isn't too much trouble for it.  &gt;Your argument that there is only one moment and everything is freeze framed is another baseless supposition on your part.   Simply calling my argument baseless without explaining what makes is baseless is a baseless response.  &gt;But even if you were right, that wouldnt even presuppose experience.  Experiences happen within the context of moments.  So even if i agreed to your laughable position of a freeze frame universe, there is still experience, lmao.    Moments occur as time passes but if time is simultaneous then the passage of time itself cannot be experienced. Every moment is a different you drawn on another piece of paper. Every piece of paper with an image printed on it simply exists. Nothing's being experienced.  &gt;Why do you try sk hard?  You have to twist logic more and more to avoid simply accepting the inevitability of existence.   Why do you keep thinking I'm denying existence itself?  &gt;What makes you think I think brains exist?  So you think that you exist because your brain makes you exist but you don't think your brain exists? Do you even logic bro?  &gt;Thank you for that concession.   How is that a concession? Of course my consciousness has its own identity. It can be differentiated from your concession can't it? Anything that can be differentiated from other things has an identity. That doesn't mean it contains a self.  I'm also going to count Everytime you say wrong without explaining why I'm wrong as an immature concession.  &gt;Then you are experiencing memories.    I am? Or is my consciousness having that experience? You can't even point to what I am that you keep saying is having experiences.  &gt;That which experiences the memories exists, that existinf thing is you.  By your own admission you exist and have experiences of memory.  Why do you keep forgetting youve already conceded to this?   Why do you keep forgetting that we agreed that we are not our consciousness's?  &gt;You literally deny you exist and then reference your own existence in your own arguments.   You mean every time  I say "I" or "me". Yeah, because it's useful. Just like how using imaginary numbers to solve problems is useful even though imaginary numbers don't exist.  &gt;Thats pretty silly.  A self is a psychosocial construction of your mind.  Therefore it exists. If you acknowledge I exist, which you have, then you must acknowledge the social construction of your "self" exists.  No two ways about it.    I guess my consciousness doesn't have as big of an ego as yours to think that it could actually manifest a self. Also I've acknowledged that your consciousness exists, not that you exist, quit making that mistake.  &gt;YOU have nothing to do with your identity.    I know, I don't have anything to do with anything, I don't exist.  &gt;Those are two different things.  Thats why its YOUR identity. Its something YOU possess and experience.  Have you noticed that you call everything yours? Your consciousness, your identity, your experiences, your memories, your mind. It's true all those things are your possessions. I just need you to tell me what is the thing that posseses those things. Face it, reality as a whole is contained by and carried by absolutely nothing.  &gt;YOU ARE THAT WHICH HAS THE EXPERIENCE.  I'm not actually having any experiences though  &gt;Yes I can? I literally have experiential the proof of this. The only kind of proof that is genuine. Thus it is proven.  I cant prove it to you, because youre not me.    This is so funny. "I have proof that I am but I can't prove that I have proof that I am. It seems like you need to work on convincing yourself that you exist before you can try to convince anyone else. Do you need to feel validated? Is that why you're going through the trouble of trying to convince others that you exist?  &gt;But Im not worried about proving it to you, as you dont matter to me and you, being not me (thus disproving your earlier assertion) cannot have my experience, thus you cannot have my experiential proof. &gt; &gt;But thats only necessary to prove my experience to you, which is not somethinf I care about.    Of course you care, that's why your here.  &gt;Your own experiences (such as the thoughts you have) are proof of your experience and thus proof of you, the thing that has the experience.  This is true even in your "spidy world" where everythinf is frozen in place.  For even then, you experience THAT, then.  So youre argument is still DOA and your back to existing and having an experience.   Cool, now tell me what it is that's experiencing existing. My consciousness doesn't see a thing that's experiencing it.  &gt;But how can you be a solopsist and not understand the concept of the illusory universe which exists only in your mind?  &gt; &gt;Thats like, solopsisms fundamental premise.  NOTHING exists except in your mind...get it?    Exactly, MY mind. It's something I possess. But what is it that posseses it? Reality is contained by nothing, and reality just occurs, like thoughts. Nothing doesn't do anything to make it occur, it just does. There doesn't need to be a you for reality to occur. If there doesn't need to be a you for reality to occur then why waste time thinking that there is a you? You are not important enough to exist.  &gt;Therefore there is no evidence that the universe exists, at all.  Because you only have proof that your thoughts (including sensory input) exist.   Wow, you really think that you manifested yourself. I had no idea I was talking to a god. BAHAHAHA  &gt;But YOU HAVE THE THOUGHTS. HAVING THOUGHTS IS THE SAME AS EXPERIENCING THOUGHTS.  THEREFOR YOU EXIST.   Just because nothing posseses everything such as thoughts doesn't mean that nothing can experience the fact that it posseses everything. Read that until it makes sense.

- &gt;I mean we are.  Youre denying my scintilla exists.  If it doesnt exist, it cant be real real.   How can it be yours if you are it?   &gt;Ill do what I want, bud.  Also, what?  I meant "twisting" obviously.  &gt;"We're talking about whether or not you can see you or experience you in any way to confirm that you exist." &gt; &gt;I experience my existence.  Duh.   Experiencing existence isn't the same thing as you experiencing the existence of a "you". And for the last time it is your consciousness experiencing existence, not you. You know this, your attempt to avoid the truth is childish   &gt;The concept of being.  You lack a "you".  So you couldnt understand what its like to actually "be".  You dont exist, after all.  There's your consciousness your referring to then. Are you your consciousness?  &gt;I do experience being me.   So then you believe that you are your consciousness then?  &gt;That wouldnt require seeing it.  I have and do, consistently, experience being me. Me which is seperate from my thoughts, feelings and conscious cognitions.  Me which experiences those things, in relation to itself.   That's your consciousness that experiences those things, it's consciousness that's in a relationship with itself. Okay so we established that you are separate from your thoughts, consciousness and so on. I assume you would also agree that you are separate from the existence your consciousness experiences. Can you tell me what it's like for you to experience this "you" without referring to conscious experience?  &gt;How could you possibly understand this unless you had a scintilla, yourself?  How could you know what its like to be wholly seperate from the congitions you have?   I'm just wondering how it's possible for you to experience a "you" that you can't interact with. It's sounds as silly as being able to look behind your perspective to see if your there. No matter where your consciousness turns it's perspective you'll never be able to see behind it to know if anything such as a "you" is there.   &gt;But you dont exist.  Your thoughts just "occur", lol.  Which is amusing (and a little sad) to think about.   So you control what thoughts you think before you think them? What's the alternative?  &gt;We dont know that.  I know the contrary, actually.   So tell me how you know. Tell me about the discovery of "you". How did your consciousness discover the fact that it was attached to something/"you".  &gt;So thats why I can confidently claim "I" exist, while you are incapable of grasping the concept of the "you" existing.    If I'm going to make some radical claim such as a planet with life in it millions of light years from here I'm at least going support that claim with the story of how I discovered that planet. Your claim is baseless. You can't tell me how you discovered "you" because you haven't. You can't even describe what the experience of "you" is like without referring to your conscious experience of existence because you never experienced a "you".  &gt;There isnt anything less than nothing, bud.  Dont be silly.   Wow you really don't know physics or math. There's debt and there's antimatter. And there are those who trespass against others.  &gt;No, I never state that.  Why cant you understand your own words when theyre handed back to yoh?   Well then I would stop referring to your conscious experiences when it comes to identifying this "you" that your consciousness claims to exist.  &gt;&gt;"The issue here is what are we if we are not our consciousness, which we clearly aren't and you stated multiple times that you agree that we are not our consciousness."  &gt;Then it isnt the issue.  Yeesh, Youre really struggling here, huh?   What? Are you saying that this whole conversation hasn't been about the supposed "you" separate from your consciousness?  &gt;&gt;"Just because your consciousness believes you exist doesn't mean that you exist."  &gt;Consciousness cannot believe anything, bud. Consciousness is the state of being aware, remember?  Whatever your definition of consciousness is, is beside the point. The fact is that the existence of a belief doesn't make the belief true. I can believe that 2+2=7, it doesn't make it true.  &gt;What?  What claims?  My thoughts and cognitions happen in relation to that which is not them, but observes and experiences them.  That is me.   Them being existence? So you are your thoughts?  &gt;&gt;"So you know that you are a spark? Have you seen it?"  &gt;Seeing a thing doesnt make a thing real, bud.  You cant beeify a thing by seeing it either.  I'm just asking if you've seen it?  &gt;&gt;"I know....questions."  &gt;I have, numerous times.  Im sorry you dont like the answers  You were doing so good with quoting me properly then you pull this shit again. Do I pull this shit with you? No. How bout a little mutual respect asshole. I leave everything I respond to perfectly intact so you know what it is that I'm responding to. I'm gonna have to back out of this comment, read what the fuck I said so I can understand why your saying what your saying in order for me to give you a proper response every fucking time you abbreviated something I said.   &gt;&gt;"Why is....now?" &gt; &gt;It isnt. Your consciousness operates without any sort of "you", just fine.  No ones saying our consciousnesses are different. Consciousness is just awareness.   &gt; &gt;Our cognitions are different, because yours just happen, in a weird sort of quasi-vacuum of non-personal existence.  Whereas mine happen in relation to that which observed them, that which experiences them, me.  You wouldnt get it.   Cognition is just an action of consciousness. Consciousness sees something, it reacts. It can even react to itself because it can see itself. As you keep saying consciousness is the state of awareness and because it's a aware it can react, so what? How does any of that make the existence of a "you" necessary?  &gt;"Actually....it?" &gt; &gt;Again,  youre poor understanding of the word consciousness renders this question meaningless.   No idea what your responding because your a dick.  &gt;If my awareness was copied and uploaded to a computer then there would be a copy of my consciousness (awareness) in the computer.   Obviously that's what the question stated, that wasn't what the question was asking. The question was would you now be on the computer with your consciousness experiencing whatever type of awareness it is experiencing?  &gt;Its not consciousness that is the issue.  Consciousness is just awareness, the state of being aware.   &gt; &gt;Youre obviously aware of thoughts, in your own way.  But the thoughts just sort of...rattle around in the void  of your mind.    Please don't pretend that the mechanism by which your thoughts operate is any different than mine. You're still not justifying the necessity of your existence in order for your consciousness/cognition/awareness to work the way that it's always worked.  &gt;So your awareness is more externalized.  Youre aware of the external world and maybe a limited sense of an inner monologue.   A limited sense, you hilarious. Don't pretend you know what my perspective is like. All I'm asking is that justify what makes the existence of you necessary? If your consciousness and all of its cognitive processes would operate just fine without the existence of a "you" then why would the existence of a "you" be necessary?  &gt;But Im aware of my thoughts  and that they exist in relation to that which is not those thoughts but is aware of them occuring. Those thoughts occur in relation to me.  I dont generate those thoughts, but I am aware of there separatness from me and in addition to that, my thoughts form a consistent and constant inner monologue, inner images, inner debates using multiple points of view, inner constructs which I can then translate into the material world using clay or a CAD program, or whatever medium of creation.   Your describing your consciousness, it's cognitive processes and it's awareness of itself. I don't see a "you" in there bud.  &gt;These things all happen in relation to me.    The "me" in this context being your perspective which is what your consciousness holds and reacts to and is aware of. But your not your consciousness remember?  Something you couldnt understand because, as you admitted,  there isnt anything equivalent inside. Youre, I guess, a body, with a brain that has neurons which fire only in regards to stimuli presented to them(?)  Cause, and effect, style.   My consciousness operates my body through the same mechanisms yours does. Quit pretending we're different. Just justify what makes you necessary. What would happen to your consciousness/awareness/cognitions if you didn't exist? Wouldn't it continue to work just the way that it is now?  I noticed you tried to skip over this question.  &gt;&gt;Why is your existence necessary for your consciousness to operate exactly the same way it's operating now?
