- BTW, it's perfectly reasonable to jump to that conclusion, but it's essentially an appeal to personal incredulity.  If you haven't yet, read The Blind Watchmaker.  Apologies for the weak arguments.
- not a very philosopher-like reply.
- this doesnt mean anything, you've just turned causality into a "deep" aphorism

- It sounds like you’re describing de realization, although I obviously can’t say for sure. I’d encourage you to look up TIPS (part of DBT strategies) and talk to a counsellor if that’s accessible to you.   I’ve been there many times and getting better feels pointless because it almost feels like I’m 
- the only thing I am battling on and off are the existential thoughts-mainly the realization of me being alive and being on this earth etc. that leaves me dissociated at times. Spaced out and scared. Now I know what it is, I am now learning how to accept those realizations as they keep coming up. I’m
- Im 18 and im thinking about everything in such an existential manner, its like im stepping out of frame and looking at things for what they really are. I have DPDR from anxiety, but i believe it has manifested into something deeper and more complex. DPDR has allowed me to think on this wavelength. I

- I view death as a new beginning, this can't be all there is, I'm afraid of being here for too long to the the point of not being able to care for myself.
- I view death as rebirth.  This gives me strength and courage.  I am actually quite fond of my own death, quite ready almost every day for the way I’m supposed to go.  Always grew up hearing, “when it’s your time to go, it’s your time to go.”  Can’t control the when, so might as well meet that fucker
- The other morning right before I got out of bed my brain told me, Hey, you’re going to die and it’ll be the only and last experience of what we call being alive will be for you, for ever until the end of time. You’ll cease to exist and within a generation or two you’ll be forgotten.   It’s scary and

- You make a lot of assumptions that are biased to its core.     "If it was truly nothing, then something can never come from nothing."   There wasn't "nothing", there was everything, just no observers yet. We've evolved to interact with our reality.     "Life is way too complicated to happen out of c
- With modern science perspective is so hard to believe that we are more than "animals with a brain". And when you think about the complexity of being you right now from billions years of cosmic events to an actual humans existence timeline who overcome mother nature, diseases, wars, ....
- Depends on what you think you are. I believe a big reason we exist is because experiencing nonexistance is a paradox, but at the same time reality is a paradox too as there really isnt any reason for all of these rules that reality runs on to exist nor for the energy that has been around

- am reading it right now, gonna tell you my thoughts after i finish it
- And as the aroma of freshly brewed coffee fills the air, I'm reminded of the simple joys that await each day. I'm grateful for another chance to participate in the exhilarating game of life, to savor its tastes, sights, and sounds. This perspective only becomes clear once we shift our gaze and view 
- Just saw your comment, clicked the video, and watched all of it in one sitting. I'm not even sure of what to say, I just wanted to thank you. I came across this thread as I was having another of of my existential crisis, and now I feeling at peace, much more calm. I'm going to buy Dr. Greyson's book

- Existentialism always leads to "create your own purpose and meaning from life".
- Existential nihilism is a philosophical theory that suggests life lacks intrinsic meaning or value, often stemming from existentialist thought focusing on individual experience, freedom, and choice. The theory posits that human life is insignificant in the vast universe, leading to feelings of despa
- Existentialist gives life a meaning by doing, not by just wanting.
